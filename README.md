# Maze Solver Application

## Description
The Maze Solver Application is a visually engaging tool that demonstrates the functionality of two pathfinding algorithms: **A*** and the 

**Right-Hand Rule**. Utilizing OpenGL for rendering, this application generates mazes and visualizes the solving process in real-time. The A* algorithm efficiently finds the shortest path from the start to the end point by evaluating possible paths based on cost and heuristic estimates, while the Right-Hand Rule algorithm follows the right wall of the maze to navigate toward the exit. Users can observe how each algorithm explores the maze, making it an excellent resource for learning about pathfinding techniques and maze generation.
